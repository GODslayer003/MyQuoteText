      {
        question: 'How does MyQuoteText analyze my quotes?',
        answer: 'Our AI uses advanced machine learning trained on thousands of Australian tradie quotes. It analyzes your quote against current market rates, identifies unusual charges, flags potential red flags, and provides cost breakdowns. The analysis is completed in real-time and saved to your account.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What information do you need from me?',
        answer: 'You can either upload a PDF quote or paste the text directly. Our system extracts key information: tradie name, price, scope of work, and timeline. You don\'t need to provide personal details like your address - just the quote itself.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How accurate is the market price comparison?',
        answer: 'Our database includes pricing data from 50,000+ Australian tradie quotes across all states. We update rates monthly based on current market conditions. Accuracy varies by trade (plumbing: 94%, electrical: 91%, general carpentry: 87%), but it\'s always your starting point for negotiation.'

        question: 'Can I have multiple accounts?',

        question: 'Can I analyze the same quote twice?',

      },
      {
        question: 'What does "Red Flag" mean?',
        answer: 'Red flags are items that appear unusual compared to market standards: vague descriptions ("labor: $2000"), extremely high/low prices, unusual payment terms, or missing information. They don\'t mean the quote is bad - just worth investigating further.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you compare my quote to market rates?',
        answer: 'We compare against our database of 50,000+ quotes from licensed tradies across Australia. We adjust for: location (Sydney vs regional), complexity, materials, and timeline. Results show if you\'re above/below average for your area.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I share my analysis with others?',
        answer: 'Yes! Download as PDF or email from your analysis page. Share the PDF with family members, other tradies for comparison, or anyone you want advice from. Your personal data is not included in the PDF.'
